#### Weights and Data

Weights can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Suq1pMC7chu1uKcS_vpeQEh0g2og8WBM?usp=sharing).

Data for training CycleGAN: [[food]](https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019)

#### Food Style Transfer

Style weights stored in './fast_neural_style_transfer/models'.

#### CycleGAN

Place data in `./datasets/` with image set pairs as `trainA` and `trainB` for training. Training time can go up to 13hrs per food mask, tested on GTX1070.

##### Development server

Run python server using `python app.py` command
