Sift flour, 1/3 cup cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl. Add to egg yolk mixture; mix until just combined.

Fold in remaining egg whites gently until no streaks of egg white remain. Do not overmix.

Pour batter into the prepared pan and gently spread evenly.

Bake in the preheated oven until cake springs back lightly when touched, about 10 minutes. Do not overbake.

Prepare dark chocolate filling. The dark chocolate will be firm set. Whip the dark chocolate, starting on low speed and working up to medium speed, until mixture crumbles. Beat until the chocolate crumbles begin to become lighter in color and texture, 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining 3/4 cup heavy cream and beat on medium-high speed until mixture is smooth, light, and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. The dark chocolate mixture will be slightly thicker than the white chocolate. Add more heavy cream if necessary to achieve the desired ""lightness"" and consistency of whipped mousse. Place whipped dark chocolate mousse into a piping bag or zip-top bag with a 1/2-inch hole cut into a corner. Keep refrigerated until ready to use.

Unroll cooled cake gently and discard parchment paper.

With a sharp knife, make several small slits in the pork roast. Place the roast into a roasting pan, and spread the spice mixture all over the roast and in the incisions. Surround the roast with celery, carrots, and onion, and season to taste with salt and black pepper.

Roast in the preheated oven until the pork roast is browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the roast reads at least 150 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 2 hours. About 15 minutes before the end of cooking, turn the oven temperature up to 425 to help brown the roast.

Remove pork roast from oven, and allow to stand for about 10 minutes before slicing. Check temperature again; roast temperature should be at least 160 degrees F (75 degrees C) before serving.

While roast is resting, place the roasting pan containing vegetables and pan drippings over a stove burner set to medium heat. Whisk in the flour, and simmer the drippings and flour for about 3 minutes to remove raw taste from flour. Whisk in the pork stock, a little at a time, until the gravy is thickened. Strain the gravy, and serve with the roast.

",,,,,,"Position oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  (Using an oven thermometer will ensure proper baking temperature since ovens vary.)  Line cushion-type baking sheets with baking parchment; set aside.  (Professional bakeries double their baking sheets and use baking parchment.)

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder; set aside.  In a large mixer bowl, cream together butter, sugars and vanilla at medium speed until creamy and light.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in corn syrup and cream or milk.  Reduce mixer speed to low.  Add flour mixture, in 3 separate batches, scraping down bowl after each addition.  Mix well to ensure full incorporation of flour mixture.  Stir in chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate) and nuts.

For each cookie, using a 1- 3/8 inch spring-loaded scoop (or 1 tablespoon measuring spoon), scoop 2 level spoonfuls of dough and roll into a ball with wet hands.  (Dough will be very sticky.  Wetting hands between every 3 rollings of dough will prevent sticking. Simply hold hands under running tap water and shake hands 10 times over sink before handling dough.  Don't worry, this will not harm the cookies.  I guarantee that this added effort will be worth it for these cookies!)   Arrange at least 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.  (Cookies will spread a bit during baking.)  Flatten each ball of dough slightly with heel of hand or fingers.

Bake for 14 minutes or until light golden brown around edges and centers are still a little puffy.  (Do not underbake this particular cookie or they will be too soft.)  Allow cookies to cool at least 5 minutes while on baking sheets before transferring (with a thin, metal cookie spatula) to wire racks to cool completely.  Repeat with remaining dough and fresh sheets of baking parchment.  Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.  (These chewy chocolate chip cookies keep better than traditional types.)

Note:  Professional chefs and pastry chefs use coarse kosher salt and I use it in my everyday cooking and baking.  It really does have a better flavor.  However, you may substitute 1 teaspoon regular table salt for 1- 1/4 teaspoons coarse kosher salt.

To Toast Nuts:  Toasting nuts brings out their flavor and makes them crisp.  It is easy to do.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Place nuts, in a single layer, on an ungreased baking sheet.  (I like to use my round non-stick pizza pan because it has a lip on it which prevents the nuts from rolling off.)  Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, stirring halfway through baking time, or until nuts become fragrant and are lightly browned.  (Watch nuts closely to prevent burning.)  Cool nuts completely before chopping and adding to recipe.  (You can speed up the cooling process by immediately placing hot, toasted nuts onto a plate and place in the freezer for 5 to 8 minutes.  Halfway through chilling time, stir the nuts to aid the cooling process.)
